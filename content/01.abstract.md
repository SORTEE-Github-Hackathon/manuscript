## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct scientific research.
With the growing role of data science in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB), the use of efficient methods to collaborate, share, and reproduce code has become fundamental. 
GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers to track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and code.
Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub by EEBÂ researchers is not widespread due to the lack of domain-specific information and guidelines.
To help EEB researchers adopt useful features from GitHub in their own workflows, we review thirteen practical ways to use the platform.
We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty: storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, and writing a manuscript.
Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration.
As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the faster our collective scientific progress, and the more our fields can be at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.
