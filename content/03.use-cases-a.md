## Twelve practical ways GitHub can accelerate research in ecology and evolution

### Storing and sharing research compendia {#storing-sharing}

<!--*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes, Emma Hudgins, Pedro Braga, Katherine HÃ©bert* -->
An EEB research compendium includes all computational materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses and protocols. 
Safely storing these files is essential to protect against accidental modifications or deletions.
Many researchers begin using GitHub to backup their research compendium [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986] into a centralized, readily-available remote server (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
This practice has the advantages of facilitating collaboration, integrating data and code archiving, allowing file versions to be accessed and restored, and further contributing to open science practices [@doi:10.1162/99608f92.9497f68e].
Changes made to files in version-controlled repositories are accompanied by authored descriptions of modifications ([Box 1](#definitions)).
Later, the entire history of commits and their commit messages are viewable and can be audited similarly to physical laboratory notebooks [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub allows administrative control over who can view and modify repositories, and the process of cloning, forking and suggesting changes through pull requests (see [Box 1](#definitions)) ensures code owners have full control over code and documents.
Repositories can be changed from public to private, allowing data storage and management without sacrificing the privacy that may be necessary for certain compendia.
With this, researchers can grant collaborators read and/or write access to files in private repositories to pursue pre-publication analyses or writing in privacy.

GitHub limits committed file sizes to 100 Mb (megabytes) [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github], which may require external file storage alternatives (such as local or cloud-hosting) for some parts of research compendia.
However, users can still track versions of remotely- or locally-stored files in their repositories using Git Large File Storage (<https://git-lfs.github.com>).

### Project continuity

Projects in ecology and evolution often involve research professionals holding limited-term positions, such as graduate students, research assistants, and post-doctoral fellows [@doi:10.5334/jors.307].
Without clear plans on project continuity, research code and data management upkeep tends to fall off as researchers move on to new projects or other institutions.
Additionally, code and data can be difficult to access and recover when kept only on personal devices [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.014].

GitHub can facilitate project continuity in research by making code and data handover between users easier [@doi:10.5334/jors.307; @doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Through version control, the history of code and data from projects in ecology and evolution becomes accessible to future laboratory members and collaborators [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160].
Repositories and organizations can have designated data and code owners [or more appropriately, "data stewards"; see @doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1, @url:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners], who can also change through time, allowing for the transition of code between research cohorts (see also ["Organizing and managing teams"](#organizations)).
Other project collaborators can contribute to repository design and development, and their active involvement can both aid authors ability to act as guarantors, and the clarity and reproducibility of the project for future users.
In (Figure @fig:github-diagram), we highlight several elements of recommended repository structure, and the various ways that contributors may interact with them.

Software compatibility during the analysis and reanalysis of project data can be ensured by storing information about software dependencies and their versions within the same project repository.
With more advanced practices, one can remotely install and execute scripts using specific versions of software within GitHub's project automation tools, GitHub Actions (see below).

In addition to projects, long-term management of laboratory materials (such as notebooks or experimental protocols) can also be done within GitHub, a practice that has been increasingly adopted across many fields [@doi:10.1038/538127a], including applied ecology (_e.g._, <https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book>), biogeography and global change biology (_e.g._, <https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work>), and microbial ecology (_e.g._, <https://github.com/CarBBAS/uqam-guide>). 


### Project management

Modern research in ecology and evolution is highly collaborative, bringing together multidisciplinary teams from various institutions [@doi:10.1890/120370].
On GitHub, collaborators can share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems (Figure @fig:github-diagram).
Project management can happen via three GitHub repository features: "Issues", "Discussion" and "Projects" ([Box 1](#definitions)).
Github Issues allow for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels.
Github Discussions serve as a message board for conversation.
Finally, GitHub Projects provides users with real-time tracking of project priorities and status [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects].
For instance, one can create a discussion on a project repository to decide which method to apply for biodiversity data analysis.
Then, an issue can be created to establish steps and responsibilities including data formatting, statistical analyses, figure generation, and issue resolution.
For example, sPlotOpen [@10.1111/geb.13346] manuscript repository contains issues and discussions tracking the development of the project (see  <https://github.com/fmsabatini/sPlotOpen_Manuscript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed>).
Using GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than email or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project. 
However, one can opt to receive new issues, discussions, and responses as emails and can post replies by email as well.
This allows for centralized communication for a team even when some members prefer to use email for communication.
Unlike emails and messages which can get lost as more new tasks arise, GitHub issues are intentionally closed by repository administrators hiding the issue from view (closed issues remain accessible but not immediately visible).

### Educational materials

<!-- *contributors to this section: Cole Brookson, PHPB* -->

GitHub supports a broad set of mechanisms for hosting educational materials.
The entire process of running a course, workshop, or lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub including material development, web hosting, and delivery, and even submission and grading of assignments.
While there are other purpose-built platforms for this, GitHub provides a free, open-source alternative.

Syllabi, presentations, and other course materials can be version-controlled, stored and managed in GitHub.
While any file type for presentations and documents can be stored and tracked in repositories, GitHub can directly render and display certain markup languages, such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Markdown documents, making these file types especially useful for educational materials.
Course content can then be delivered to the audience by sharing links of web-hosted GitHub Pages (see [Hosting a Website](#hosting-a-website)), GitHub Repositories and/or GitHub Organizations.
Finally, instructors can host and assign student work to be submitted collaboratively or individually as code and text files, and even build autograding tests using the GitHub Classroom tool (<https://classroom.github.com>).

Although time-consuming, adopting these features in classrooms can integrate the learning of version-control and GitHub practices with the learning of course contents, and thus boost students' feelings of self-efficacy and confidence [@doi:10.1187/cbe.13-12-0241].
