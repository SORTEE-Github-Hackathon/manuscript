## Twelve practical ways GitHub can accelerate research in ecology and evolution

### Storing and sharing research compendia

<!--*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes, Emma Hudgins, Pedro Braga* -->
An EEB research compendium includes all computational materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses and protocols.
Having copies of these files safely stored is essential to protect against accidental modifications or deletions.
Many researchers begin using GitHub as a means to store (or backup) their research compendium [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986] to a centralized, readily-available remote server (see [Box 1](#definitions)).
A centralized research compendium stored in a version-controlled repository has the advantages of facilitating collaboration, integrating data and code archiving services, allowing file versions to be accessed and restored, and contributes to open science (see sections below).

GitHub limits committed file sizes to 100 Mb (megabytes) (@https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github), which can make it challenging for centralizing research compedia containing larger file sizes. 
Users may still version large files using Git Large File Storage (LFS; @https://git-lfs.github.com/) text pointers, but may have to rely on external file storage alternatives (such as local or cloud-hosting).

### Virtual laboratory notebooks

Laboratory notebooks help researchers track their research notes, methods, policies and protocols [@doi:10.1186/s13321-017-0221-3].
Virtual laboratory notebooks can be stored in GitHub repositories and provide the benefits of simultaneous, centralized and selective access, and allows for the easy update of policies and experiment protocols [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385].
Researchers have been increasingly using GitHub to maintain versions and share digital laboratory notebooks [@doi:10.1038/538127a] (_e.g._, <https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book>; <https://github.com/HuckleyLab/how_we_work>). 

At least for aspects of a research project that involve writing code, a GitHub repository is a form of a laboratory notebook; when changes are made to files in a version controlled repository, the author of those changes makes a commit ([Box 1](#definitions)) accompanied by a description of changes. 
Later, the entire history of commits and their commit messages are viewable and can be audited similar to a physical laboratory notebook [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub issues ([Box 1](#definitions)) can be used to prioritize laboratory objectives and goals, as well as track any status updates.

### Project management

Modern research in ecology and evolution is highly collaborative, bringing together multidisciplinary teams from various institutions.
On GitHub, collaborators can share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems (Figure @fig:github-diagram).
Project management can happen via three GitHub repository features: "Issues", "Discussion" and "Projects".
Github Issues allow for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels.
Github Discussions serve as a message board for conversation.
Finally, GitHub Projects integrate issues and pull requests on automated spreadsheets and project boards, providing users with real-time tracking of project priorities and status [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects].
Scripts, commit messages, and pull requests can be linked directly to issues, discussions, and projects providing a clear record of project workflow.
The use of GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than e-mail or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project.
Unlike emails and messages which can get lost as more new tasks arise, GitHub issues are intentionally closed by repository administrators hiding the issue from view (closed issues remain accessible but not immediately visible).
Project management in GitHub can also be integrated with third-party applications, such as ZenHub (https://www.zenhub.com/) or Slack (https://slack.github.com/).
ZenHub allows for the enhanced visualization and organization of repositories and their issues, while the GitHub for Slack integration allows notifications from GitHub events to be sent directly to users or group channels [@url:https://slack.com/help/articles/232289568-GitHub-for-Slack].

### Educational materials

<!-- *contributors to this section: Cole Brookson* -->

GitHub supports a broad set of mechanisms for hosting educational materials.
The entire process of running a course, workshop, or lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub including material development, web hosting, and delivery, and even submission and grading of assignments.
While there are other purpose-built platforms for this, GitHub provides a free, open-source alternative.

Making presentations, syllabi and other course materials can be done through most major high-level programming languages such as R, with `RMarkdown` [@isbn:9781138359338], Python, with `python-ppt` (<https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io>), and Julia, with `Remark.jl` (<https://juliapackages.com/p/remark>), and be version-controlled and stored in GitHub.
Once content is made, hosting a course website can be done through GitHub Pages [@url:https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart] (_e.g._, https://github.com/topics/course-website>).
This way, the course content can be available to enrolled students, as well as a global pool of learners and teachers interested in the course material.
Content can then be delivered via the course website, and/or a GitHub Organization with, for example, template repositories for assignments.
Student submissions are perhaps the most challenging component, but the new GitHub Classroom tool (<https://classroom.github.com>) allows instructors to host private assignments to be submitted collaboratively or individually as code or PDF files, and even build autograding tests.
Although time-consuming to establish, using these features can integrate learning version control and GitHub with the learning course content, and thus boost students feelings of self-efficacy and confidence [@doi:10.1187/cbe.13-12-0241].
