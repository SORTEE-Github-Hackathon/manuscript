### General pargrah on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo  
*Contributors to this section: Rob*   

There have been many calls for researchers outside of the software development community to join the 73 million GitHub users for their collaborative research.  
Until now, resources and practical guideance specifically focused on using GitHub within the EEB community have been dispersed in blog posts and video tutorials.
In this paper, we describe 13 tractable ways that EEB researchers can leverage GitHub to enable more transparent and collaborative research.  
Many of the examples are specifically meant for first-time GitHub users and can likely be adopted with just several hours of practice (e.g., storing data, creating virtual notebooks, making code citable).  
The other examples we describe may require a greater time commitment but have the potential to make EEB research even more open, accessible, and collaborative than ever before (e.g., hosting classroom material, writing a manuscript, managing research projects).  
Despite the many potential applications of GitHub to EEB research, we acknowledge that there will still be many times when researchers might look to other platforms for research collaboration. 

### When to look to other platforms for collaboration  
*Contributors to this section: Rob*  
Though we see GitHub as a useful tool for collaboration in EEB, we describe 2 use cases where, to our knowledge, GitHub's features still fall short of the type of highly collaborative work emblamatic of EEB research.  
First, because of the underlying version control system which tracks "pushed" changes through "commits", real-time collaborative editing (e.g., as on a shared Google Doc or a Word document stored on Dropbox) is not possible on GitHub.  
There are now websites outside of the GitHub ecosystem that are built on top of the GitHub architecture that allow real-time collaboartive editing (e.g., [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/).  
We used HackMD at two key points in writing our manuscript when real-time co-writing was essential: when taking meeting notes and writing the outline of our paper.  
Despite the extra layer of coordination required to use GitHub to write a paper, many journals are changing their manuscript formatting requirements to allow for manuscript format output from GitHub [@doi:10.1038/d41586-020-00916-6].  
Second, we looked to other software when working on figures and tables.
Creating tables and figures on GitHub using markdown or other scripting languages is possible, we found that it was not practical at the early brainstorming stages.
We needed to rapidly iterate on figure and table design, share feedback through comments, and merge/reorder ideas when necessary.
For these reasons, we used Google Slides for working on figures and Google Sheets for working on tables.
As our figures and tables moved toward more finalized forms, some co-authors chose to create the tables and figures using R and Markdown which could then be tracked using the same version control system as the rest of manuscript.

### Why aren't more EEB researchers using GitHub
*Contributors to this section: Saeed* 
Learning to use GitHub requires time, and because the basics of version control are not taught in EEB curricula, students and researchers need to make the decision to adopt these tools on their own.  
 is not taught in but the payoff is *[may be?]* worth it.
Time vs. effort examples or analyses to demonstrate the payoff can help drive the point home to convince people to learn these tools
GitHub could be used for learning materials and collaborative platform for education and scientific contributions
After GitHub’s 2007 release...


### Our own limitations in writing this paper

*Contributors to this section: Ali*

Our own limitations since we are mostly writing from the EcoEvo perspective/ additional github limitation
Reliance on R since we are generally in EcoEvo
Discussion of free vs. paid plans. When projects get highly collaborative may have to add / pay for accounts. At this point, little difference between paid and free.

File size limitations make it hard to sync entire folders with the cloud, especially if your repo is private. 
One trick to increase the size limit associated with a repository is to attach additional large files to the release once the repository is finalized and ready for re-use.

While we have written this manuscript collaboratively via GitHub and GitHub Actions, there was a substantial learning curve, and we are all early career researchers who are highly motivated to learn these skills.
This approach is likely less practical when collaborating with people at later career stages and a greater range of computational skills.
Real-time collaboration via GitHub is also not possible without relying on additional tools such as hackmd, so there is a longer delay to receive feedback from other collaborators, and a greater likelihood of conflicts.

Lack of GitHub help documents for non-English researchers in ecology and evolution leads them to miss the opportunity to fully understand the importance version control as well as the other benefits of GitHub.

### Using GitHub is a good start, but lots of practices to make repo more user friendly

Note: "Current tips copied from the "Figure_brainstorming_v2, 6th slide" from the Google Drive"
can be extended as much as we can. 
Later we decide the most important ones related the manuscript. 
All suggestions are welcome.

Tips:

1- Check for the solution to your problem on the Github Help [webpage](https://docs.github.com/en).
This site contains very extensive and detailed documents with helpful screenshots. 
It is useful for getting startet in general, but also has troubleshooting tips for specific problems.  

2- Consider taking free courses from [Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and sharing these courses with your lab members of colleagues.

3- See the repository for [this paper](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/) as an example of a collaborative manuscript that includes discussions, issues, and a website.

4- The GitHub [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) allows you to learn GitHub basics through short projects and taks, and allows you to get feedback from their Learning Lab bot.

5- Check out the following [markdown cheatsheet](http://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) so that you can write clear metadata README files for your repositories.

6- The Jenny Bryan universe of GitHub material provides a thorough and accessible introduction for a multitude of research-related uses for GitHub, and includes a [book](http://happygitwithr.com), [statistics course](http://stat545.com/) and [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].

7- Don't be afraid of trial and error. 
One of the best ways to learn Github is the trial and error method. 
Learning from the mistakes can be the best way to remember, and Github has the advantage of making it easy to go back to any steps that you desire via version controlling if you make mistakes. 

8- If you are an educator, include lectures on reproducibility and tools for creating reproducible workflows in your curricula. 
Some gradute programs now include coursework on course Rmarkdown and GitHub.
Getting students started with these tools earlier will prevent the resistance that comes from working with a less reproducible workflow for a longer period of time.

9- Consider Tweeting your issue. 
There is a large community of GitHub users around the world who have likely faced analogous problems and may be able to provide quick solutions. 

10- Other blogs? e.g.(https://github.blog/) twitter accounts? or YouTube training videos

11- Try to begin commiting with GUI (Graphical user interface) tools e.g. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) tools instead CLI (Command line interface) tools such as Terminal or Console.
