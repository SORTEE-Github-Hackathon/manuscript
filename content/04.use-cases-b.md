### Creating a website

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins*   -->
Personal or lab websites are one method of improving the dissemination of research findings and coordination of research efforts, but most EEB researchers have little experience in building or hosting webpages.
GitHub Pages (<https://pages.github.com>) is a feature that, when activated for a repository, renders content written in markdown (e.g., <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/main-website>) as an HTML web page with a URL (e.g., <https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/main-website/>).
This can be useful for sharing reports (e.g. written with RMarkdown and rendered to HTML) with collaborators, or for more complex projects like personal, project, or lab websites.
GitHub also offers website templates and it is possible to create a website by forking ([Box 1](#definitions)) a repository hosting a GitHub Pages site as a starting point.
Aside from free hosting services, another benefit is that GitHub Pages are autogenerated, meaning that when content is modified in the associated GitHub repository, the website instantly updates [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].
Though the templates are useful for quickly starting up a new website, users are able to fully customize their Pages websites (for technical details of customizing GitHub Pages site see [@isbn:9781491933503]).
We emphasize that despite the many benefits of using GitHub pages (free hosting, templates, customization), this avenue for creating a website will often be more time intensive than the out-of-the-box platforms. "Static websites" (i.e., websites where every user sees the same content) can be created using Jekyll (<https://jekyllrb.com>) and Hugo (<https://gohugo.io>), which also include template libraries for websites that can be hosted freely via GitHub pages. 
Several R packages such as distill (<https://github.com/rstudio/distill>) and blogdown (<https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown>) have made the interface to these website generators more accessible. 
In addition, Quarto (<https://quarto.org>) has options for creating websites (<https://quarto.org/docs/websites>) as well as the code-free website generator wowchemy (<https://wowchemy.com>) which uses Hugo. 

### Archiving citable code and data

<!--*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins, Dylan Gomes*-->

GitHub makes it easy to store and share a variety of data files in the cloud.
If a repository is made "public" the URL to the repository can be shared freely with others.
However, for a variety of reasons (e.g., privately owned company, ability to make repositories private, accounts can be deleted at will) GitHub is not considered a long-term data or code repository like Zenodo and Figshare [@doi:10.1038/538127a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947; @tbl:compare].
Also, unlike long-term repositories, GitHub does not issue Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for content uploaded to their servers.
DOIs are persistent and unique alpha-numeric IDs assigned to research products like papers, code, and data.
DOIs allows tracking and citing research products.
For this reason, scientists who share code and data through GitHub are strongly encouraged to also submit GitHub repository content to a long-term data archive [@doi:10.1029/2021EA001797].
Fortunately, both long-term repositories mentioned above (Zenodo and Figshare) have integrations with GitHub.
After linking one's GitHub repository to Zenodo or Figshare, every time a release ([Box 1](#definitions)) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived with a versioned, citable DOI.
Linking one's GitHub repository with Zenodo, etc. to obtain a DOI helps work become findable, gives proper attribution, and can ensure long-term stability [@doi:10.1890/ES14-00402.1].

Many researchers believe that their code is not useful because their analysis is context-specific and not explicitly designed for re-use like software.
However, there are many reasons to share data and code beyond re-use.
Even if code lacks detailed annotation, it shows the exact steps taken to conduct an analysis, and therefore provides the most detailed look into how to reproduce a given analysis [@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006].
This is important in light of the reproducibility crisis [@doi:10.1038/533452a] and will become increasingly important to the collective scientific enterprise as advances in computing power and accessibility unlock the ability to conduct 'big data' meta research with data that has already been collected by others.
Failing to include data and code with publications leaves future scientists with fewer open resources from which to understand the world.

An important aspect of making code citable and reusable is adding an appropriate licence.
Code without a licence is (by default) actually provided more protection from reuse than code with an open licence.
The standard GitHub licensing options are best suited for software, so depending on how you want your code to be used you can choose one of the other license options.
For example, if your code is intended only for your specific analysis, consider a Creative Commons License.
If you wish to receive attribution for any reuse of your code, consider a CC BY 4.0 license.
If you have built an app, tool, package, or other product that you would like others to use and would like attribution for any reuse of your code, consider the GNU General Public License v3.
This license also prohibits the re-user from making their re-used version private.
To help navigate through the potential licenses available to you and their attributes the Choose a License (<https://choosealicense.com/non-software/>) website can offer further guidance.

### Collaborative (code) editing and asynchronous working

<!--*Contributors to this section: Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Ali, Allison Binley*-->

GitHub facilitates collaborative coding and asynchronous working because researchers can seamlessly access and contribute to data and code regardless of disparities in schedules or location. 
Project work can also be clearly split among team members, giving them the flexibility to contribute when it best fits their schedule. 
We acknowledge that there are important differences between the average software developer and EEB researcher using GitHub, and that not all of GitHub's features are useful for research workflows ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).
However, git's core features such as forking and branching ([Box 1](#definitions)) allow for simultaneous coding on different versions of the same research project, and alternative versions can be discussed and resolved with GitHub.
When EEB projects are contained on the GitHub platform, researchers can stay abreast of progress made by other collaborators without the need for meetings or emails.
Version control [@https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/manuscript/v/latest/index.html#storing-and-archiving-version-controlled-data] features also allow users to make progress and changes without worrying about irreparably writing over someone else's work.
By enabling more comprehensive remote collaboration, GitHub encourages the exchange of ideas among researchers at different institutions and in different countries, which can serve to improve the quality of the research itself by providing open access to data and code.
In academic settings, GitHub can also facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors.
Periodic code review [@doi:10.1145/3341525.3387370] can also help advisors identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills.

### Writing a manuscript

<!--*contributors to this section:* Emma J. Hudgins-->

Beyond supporting collaboration at the level of code, GitHub can be used for collaboratively writing manuscripts. 
Writing a manuscript in GitHub and storing it with associated data and code all in the same repository increases scientific reproducibility because files associated with a manuscript can be found in one place.
Co-authors can contribute new text to a manuscript or suggest revisions through GitHub's robust pull request feature ([Box 1](#definitions)) which provides a line-by-line view of all proposed changes.
Further, authors can make use of the Discussions tab to suggest relevant papers to be cited, and can raise issues during the writing process that can be assigned to collaborators ([Table 1](#tbl:roles)).

While GitHub is not considered as user-friendly for manuscript development as conventional text processors [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7], it has been substantially improved with recent tools.
Manuscripts can be written on GitHub with Markdown.
Add-ons like HackMD (<https://hackmd.io>), can enable real-time collaboration for individual Markdown documents.
Many tools exist for extending Markdown and Pandoc to add formatting features necessary for scientific writing like in-text citations and figure and table cross references.

We wrote this manuscript using Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a collaborative manuscript platform that uses Markdown for writing and GitHub for storing and tracking changes to a manuscript over time.
Manubot uses a GitHub Actions-based typesetting system to compile individual Markdown files stored in a GitHub repository into a single LaTeX document, which can be displayed in Word, HTML, or PDF formats.
The resulting manuscript can also be compiled using a journal's .tex template to match their formatting requirements.
Since this tool reruns the entire manuscript compilation process with any change to the underlying repository, it can also accomodate continuous integration of code updates into figures and tables with additional GitHub Actions (e.g. https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/tree/main/.github/workflows).
Manubot also allows for straightforward citation management based on URLs or DOIs. 
For more examples of Manubot being used for manuscripts, see [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].

Since Manubot works on documents in a distributed format, it can be difficult to edit manuscripts for overall flow with only this tool.
We employed hypothes.is (<https://hypothes.is>) to write comments on the HTML manuscript document produced by Manubot, which we then addressed by committing changes to the underlying Markdown files via pull requests.
Other authors can reply to the comments to indicate agreement or disagreement, and to note when changes have been made.
Other tools can also be used for version control of scientific manuscripts including R Markdown via the bookdown package (<https://bookdown.org/>), jupyter notebooks [@doi:10.1038/s42005-020-00403-4] and a relatively new tool, Quarto (<https://quarto.org>).

### Peer-Review

<!--*contributors to this section:* Eric R. Scott-->
Peer review plays a critical role in the scientific evaluation of EEB research.
GitHub provides an open and transparent platform that can be used for either directly providing feedback on research products or building a to-do list from reviewer comments.
Peer review of research software by the open software development community rOpenSci (https://ropensci.org/software-review/) and of research software and associated manuscripts by the Journal of Open Source Software (https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html) requires that submitted work is hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub issues.
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including rfishbase [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and taxize [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].  

GitHub can also be used as a hub for reviewers and authors during the peer review process of an ordinary research manuscript.
If the code associated with a manuscript is made available at the time of submission (e.g. via a link to a GitHub repository in a Data Availability Statement), peer-reviewers may be able to offer more helpful suggestions on written methods and may even make comments on the code itself, potentially catching bugs or errors before publication.
GitHub can also be used as a hub for reviewers and authors during the peer review process of an ordinary research manuscript.
GitHub issues can be used to organize and discuss reviewer suggestions and to assign them to co-authors (See example in <https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+>).
When reviewer comments are posted as separate issues, authors can comment on the issues to discuss possible changes and assign themselves to indicate which comments they intend to handle.
Co-authors can then integrate their edits and responses to reviewers using pull requests.

Some specialized journals, such as the the Journal of Open Source Software (<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>), require that submitted work is hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub issues.
Peer review of research software by rOpenSci (<https://ropensci.org/software-review/>) also makes use of many features of GitHub to streamline and automate parts of the review process.
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including rfishbase [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and taxize [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].
Although the use of GitHub in peer-review is currently restricted to these specialized cases, they may provide a model for peer-review in more traditional EEB journals for manuscripts that make use of code.
