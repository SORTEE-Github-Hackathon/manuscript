better to have old versions on GitHub than on somebody's personal hard drive!

Whether experiments are done in a wetlab, data are gathered in a field site, or analyses are run in a shared office, even conceptually distinct projects are often carried out in a common physical space. 
GitHub Organisations offer a shared virtual space that allows a team to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger figurehead, such as a laboratory, a department, an organisation, or a large project involving several teams. 
Organisations are well-suited to ensure larger projects with many steps or moving parts are constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on any one individual. 
Because the repositories are grouped in one virtual space, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organisation, which allows administrators to assign roles and tasks to groups of people. 
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing each team to be granted access to certain repositories, and not to others. 
This ensures that more sensitive repositories remain as restricted as needed, while repositories with greater general interest can be easily accessible to many members at once.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to house documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other such documents that evolve collaboratively over time and are relevant to many colleagues. 
In this way, students or teams can have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on (or upgraded their computers). 
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked under a given institution, such as the [German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)](https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity).
Of course, the utility of this tool goes beyond laboratories - they are useful to structure the organisation, presentation, and outcomes of working groups such as the hackathon which inspired this paper ([SORTEE-Github-Hackathon](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon)) by keeping track of all materials as ideas develop and take shape in one virtual space.
Organisations are also convenient for hosting a set of related learning materials such as a set of lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series ([QCBSRworkshops](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops)) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club ([Coding Club](https://github.com/ourcodingclub)), which may be updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors over time.

Utilizing GitHub organizations as a research group or even for a handful of individuals working on a group of projects can be incredibly useful for all involved. 
GitHub organizations are relatively easy to set up, and especially easy to manage as membership to the organization changes through time. 
Not only is it a useful way to store repositories of lab-related research products, but it's also incredibly helpful for storing "living documents" that may be edited frequently, and may be linked to a lab website (that could also be generated via a repository that lives within the organization!). 
The use of the "Teams" feature can allow certain groups to have varying levels of access to repos in the organization with a select group having push access to some repos but not others. 
This can manifest in a group working on some common dataset(s) (e.g. some genetic data) to have push access to the handful of repositories used for processing sequence data, while another group of students/researchers may have push access to an entirely different set of repos. 
The organization structure also allows for easy tracking of issues, projects, and discussions related to the research group, and provides PIs/group leads an easy birds-eye view of the progress going on across multiple projects.

As well, organizations provide a convenient location for students to archive the code for their projects, for use/reference by future students in the research group, thus providing a type of knowledge communication that may not exist otherwise. 
Indeed, providing new students with access to the organization and ideally a template repository for lab projects can soften the burden on those new to the software, in that it provides them with examples to work off of, and an online location to ask for help from their labmates and/or advisors through tools like projects, discussions, and issues.

### Additional uses for GitHub in EcoEvo research

There are many more ways that EEB researchers can use GitHub for accelerating research collaborations, and we briefly highlight several here.  
First, there are increasing calls for ecological data to be more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) [@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2019.04.005; @doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18].  
A key component of data reusability is standardizing the ways (e.g., variable names, file formats) that research data are archived in long-term repositories.  
Recently, community-led data standardization efforts are taking place on GitHub [@doi:10.1029/2021EA001797], where documents and templates can be version controlled and commented on by the user community [e.g., ESS-DIVE's GitHub Community Space](https://github.com/ess-dive-community).  

Ecologists who write code often use the R programming language, and the (rOpenSci)[https://ropensci.org/] community has a well-established software peer review process that involves both rOpenSci's staff software engineers and the broader R user community.  
Their (software review GitHub repository)[https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/] provides instructions for submitting an R package for review as well as guidelines for code reviewers.  
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including rfishbase[@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and taxize[@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].  

Lastly, (GitHub gists)[https://gist.github.com/] let users create and share snippets of code, notes, and files quickly.  
Rather than create an entire GitHub repository for saving a small code chunk you want to use in a presentation or share with a colleague, GitHub gists provide a lightweight way to write, save, and share code.  
Gists are associated with your Github account and can be public or private.  
Though gists lack all the features embedded in a GitHub repository, gists can still be forked, starred, downloaded, and easily added into a website or blog post.
