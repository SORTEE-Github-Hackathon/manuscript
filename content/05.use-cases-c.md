### Open science discussion

Scientific publications often omit part of their intellectual and computational workflows, including the treatment of raw data and analytical steps (_e.g._, model assumption testing).
Publishing data and reproducible workflows along with manuscripts can provide readers with all details about analytical steps and enable reproducing research experiments and results [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000763].
In addition to storing data and code, GitHub repositories can provide a time-stamped (version controlled) preregistration of research plans and hypotheses.

Conventional research practices typically separate tasks among collaborators (_i.e._, data entry, analysis, writing).
It is common that coauthors discuss, but do not actively verify, edit, or execute research tasks that are not their main responsibility.
GitHub can serve as a tool for open and tractable research development.
Collaborators can directly interact with code and data, inspect for errors, and potentially identify scientific misconduct prior to manuscript submission [_e.g._, @doi:10.1038/d41586-022-02156-2; @doi:10.1038/d41586-020-00287-y; <https://ecologyforthemasses.com/2020/02/04/pruittdata-and-the-ethics-of-data-in-science>].
Collaborators and readers are better positioned to discover erroneous or questionable findings if they have complete and transparent access to projects.

This transparency can be extended beyond co-authors to the entire scientific community and to the public.
Supplying code for novel or currently used methods reduces barriers to knowledge, improving the ability of others to build on existing work.
This practice results in greater proliferation and accessibility for a broader audience.
Projects can make use of GitHub Discussions (<https://docs.github.com/en/discussions>) to communicate among repository members (collaborators) and to engage with other scientists and the general public.
Moreover, researchers can also use the GitHub Community (<https://github.community/>) forum to share expertise or request help from others on their analyses and ideas ([Table 2](#tbl:roles)).

The desire or need for privacy during the developmental stages of a manuscript or of a larger research project is common in EEB, and this is often perceived as a major barrier to doing science openly.
Because GitHub repositories can be made private or public at any time, there is no need to choose privacy over open science, or vice-versa. 
Repositories can be kept private until their contents are ready to be shared publicly, as might occur when a research article is published or when an embargo is lifted.

### Automation

<!--*Contributors to this section: PHPB -->

Automation has the strong potential to expand the scale and pace of research in ecology and evolution [@doi:10.1126/science.abi4692].
Automation frameworks can streamline many stages of the scientific process, including data collection and data validation [_e.g._, @doi:10.3389/fevo.2021.679673; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125], data analysis [_e.g._, @doi:10.1038/nbt.3780], unit testing of research code [_e.g._, @doi:10.12688/f1000research.9315.1], archiving and deployment of data, code and reports [_e.g._, this manuscript, @doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13104], and the interpretation, integration and usage of data and software across different sources [see @doi:10.1038/sdata.2017.114].
In this context, small modifications to code and data can be frequently committed and automatically tested, as in continuous integration and continuous deployment practices [@doi:10.1109/MS.2014.58].
This allows for early detection and correction of errors, potentially improving confidence in scientific development by minimizing software errors [see @doi:10.12688/f1000research.5930.2].
In addition to increasing scientific rigour and confidence in ecological software [@doi:10.1890/080141], automation can help advance more rapidly sharing ecological data and making sure the data are high quality [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1710231115].
Integrating automation workflows has been highly encouraged in areas of EEB, including predictive ecology [@doi:10.1111/ele.13994], long-term ecological studies [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125; @doi:10.1101/332783], and management of species at risk information [@doi:10.1038/s41597-022-01381-8].

Automation can be integrated into GitHub repositories through the GitHub Actions feature [@url:https://github.com/features/actions], or through alternative automation systems [_e.g._, Circle CI, @url:https://circleci.com]; Travis CI, @url:https://www.travis-ci.com].
Users can set up workflows associated with their repositories that are triggered by events (_e.g._, push, pull request or at specified times) for remote servers to perform user-specified steps and actions.
These actions are highly configurable and have numerous applications, such as automatically running analyses and creating figures when data or code are updated, incorporating changes to websites or applications, testing modifications to software (_e.g._, R or Python libraries).
Action workflows can be found in GitHub's Marketplace (<https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions>) or, alternatively, in open user repositories.

### Organizing and managing teams{#organizations}

<!--*Contributors to this section: Katherine Hébert, Cole Brookson, Pedro Henrique P. Braga*-->

GitHub Organizations are shared virtual spaces that allow teams to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger group, such as a laboratory, department, or project involving several teams.
Organizations allow larger projects with many steps or moving parts to be constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on individuals.
Because the repositories are grouped, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organization, which allows administrators to assign roles, tasks, and repository modification permissions to organization members.
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing teams to be granted access to specific repositories.
This ensures repositories with sensitive information remain as restricted as needed, while others stay open and accessible to selected member groups.
The organization structure also allows for issue tracking and discussions related to research content and progress.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to host documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other relevant documents that evolve collaboratively over time. 
In this way, teams have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on or when locally-stored data are lost.
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked to institutions [_e.g._, the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv, <https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity>)].
The team organizing the hackathon which inspired this article used a GitHub Organization (SORTEE-Github-Hackathon, <https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon>) to centralize the project development, from meeting notes to, ultimately, this manuscript.
Organizations are also convenient for hosting learning materials, including lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series (QCBSRworkshops, <https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops>) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club (Coding Club, <https://github.com/ourcodingclub>), which may be continuously updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors.
